# 0x01. Python - Async
Introduction to Python async covering the following:

+ async and await syntax
+ How to execute an async program with asyncio
+ How to run concurrent coroutines
+ How to create asyncio tasks
+ How to use the random module

## Tasks

### 0. The basics of async
Write an asynchronous coroutine that takes in an integer argument (max_delay, with a default value of 10) named wait_random that waits for a random delay between 0 and max_delay (included and float value) seconds and eventually returns it.

Use the random module.

file: [0-basic_async_syntax.py](0-basic_async_syntax.py)

test file: [tests/0-main.py](tests/0-main.py)


### 1. Let's execute multiple coroutines at the same time with async
Import wait_random from the previous python file that youâ€™ve written and write an async routine called wait_n that takes in 2 int arguments (in this order): n and max_delay. You will spawn wait_random n times with the specified max_delay.

wait_n should return the list of all the delays (float values). The list of the delays should be in ascending order without using sort() because of concurrency. 

file: [1-concurrent_coroutines.py](1-concurrent_coroutines.py)

test file: [tests/1-main.py](tests/1-main.py)


### 2. Measure the runtime
From the previous file, import wait_n into 2-measure_runtime.py.

Create a measure_time function with integers n and max_delay as arguments that measures the total execution time for wait_n(n, max_delay), and returns total_time / n. Your function should return a float.

Use the time module to measure an approximate elapsed time.

file: [2-measure_runtime.py](2-measure_runtime.py)

test file: [tests/2-main.py](tests/2-main.py)


### 3. Tasks
Import wait_random from 0-basic_async_syntax.

Write a function (do not create an async function, use the regular function syntax to do this) task_wait_random that takes an integer max_delay and returns a asyncio.Task.

file: [3-tasks.py](3-tasks.py)

test file: [tests/3-main.py](tests/3-main.py)


### 4. Tasks
Take the code from wait_n and alter it into a new function task_wait_n. The code is nearly identical to wait_n except task_wait_random is being called.
